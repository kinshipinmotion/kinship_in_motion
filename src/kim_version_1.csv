BREADNUT ISLAND PEN (1767-1774)","Molia first appeared in the diary in December of 1761. Thistlewood purchased her in a group sale of five other Africans from a trader for 50 pounds. Upon her arrival to Egypt estate, he paired her with an enslaved fieldwoman named Wonga (also known as Princess) to be 'seasoned'. One week after her purchase, he put her to work in Egypt's fields.

 Four years following her purchase, Molia gave birth to a mixed race baby girl named Silvia. When Silvia was fifteen months old, Thistlewood hired Molia to labor on Masemure, a neighboring sugar plantation. He forced her to leave Silvia behind and in the care of Nanny, another enslaved mother of a little girl named Little Phibbah who was the same age as Silvia. Shortly after their separation, Silvia fell sick and died. 

Molia was never the same following Silvia's death. She never had any more children, and and she also refused to stay in place. Over the course of the next six years, she would run away no less than fourteen times. The seventh of these escapes was to a place called Bluefields Bay, to see a person Molia herself identified as a ""Shipmate,"" a person who had survived the Middle Passage voyage with her to Jamaica. The fourteenth of these escapes (and the last that she would make in Jamaica) was to an estate called Paradise; it was the same estate where Molia had been sent to give birth to Silvia. 

Following this fourteenth recapture, Thistlewood sold Molia to another slave owner, who transported her away from Jamaica, and to the British colony of Savannah. Georgia."

Upon her arrival to Egypt estate, he paired her with an enslaved fieldwoman named Egypt Lucy to be 'seasoned'. After renaming her ""Maria,"" a mere one week after her purchase, he put Ogo to work in Egypt's fields.

Five years after her arrival in Jamaica, Ogo gave birth to her first child: a daughter named Lucy. Her father was most likely Solon, an enslaved field laborer  and sometimes driver whom Thistlewood purchased a few months before Ogo. Over the next several years, Ogo would have several more sexual partners/spouses, including another enslaved man at the neighboring Retrieve estate, an enslaved man named Peter owned by another of Thistlewood's friends named Wilson, and an enslaved man from Egypt estate named Cubbena. Thistlewood forced himself upon her sexually several times.

 The diary also confirms Ogo as having two more children: a boy born in 1770 who died at seven days old of tetanus, and another daughter named Rachael  born in 1771 who would die in 1775 at four years old. Her eldest daughter, Lucy would fall sick of stomach pains and convulsions and die in 1777 at the age of ten.

Throughout her childhood, she mostly lived apart from her mother on Paradise, a neighboring sugar estate that was also owned by their owners John and Mary (Molly) Copeand served as a domestic servant to Molly Cope. Accubah was later sent to a school for mixed race children at an early age to learn to read and write.

In addition to being frequently separated from her mother, Accubah was frequently the target of sexual predation from white men, including John Cope and a white laborer on Egypt named Sam Matthews who attempted to rape her in Egypt's boiling house in before being thwarted, ironically enough, by Thistlewood himself. She was one of the only enslaved girls/women in the diary who he never forced himself upon sexually.

Accubah had a number of sexual partners over the years who were mostly either free mixed race men of color, or white men. Three of the mixed race men were described as being her 'husband': Mulatto Davie in 1761, Nagua in 1766 (who also appeared to have grown up with Accubah on the estate), and Jimmy Stewart in 1776.

Accubah was an accomplished seamstress, who put her skills to good use in taking on paid sewing jobs for Thistlewood, and also sewing intricate messages into the dresses and bodices of her fellow enslaved women.

At some point during the late 1760's Accubah became involved in the cult society of Myalism; an Afro-Jamaican religion that according to what some scholars have argued was “the first religious organization of Africans in Jamaica” that “addressed itself to the entire slave society."" Myal was organized around the premise that enslaved people could inure themselves to the many dangers and predations from white

Accubah was very close with her mother PhIbbah, and with her mother Phibbah's friends: Accubah's aunt Nancy, an enslaved domestic woman who also lived at Paradise named House Franke, an enslaved domestic woman and healer named Vine from Cabaritta estate and an enslaved field woman from Egypt named Egypt Lucy. Together, the six women pooled the money and resources they earned through the selling of goods they raised from their provison grounds, their raising of livestock, and from sewing work they were contracted to perform for whites. They intended the funds to be used to purchase at least one of each other's freedom.

Accubah was very fond of hearing Anansi spider tales told by her mother's close friend, an enslaved healer from Cabarittta Estate named Vine. She made regular trips to her mother's later residence of Breadnut Island Pen to hear them under the cover of night.

Accubah traveled abroad to England twice in her lifetime; once in 1767 and once in the spring of 1771, as a domestic to the Cope's two daughters. On her second trip, she was baptized into the Church of England and christened 'Jenny Young', a name she would go by for the rest of her life after returning to Jamaica.

Accubah had seversl children over the course of her life, but only one of whom would survive into childhood: Little Nancy (presumably named after her Aunt).

Like her mother, Accubah/Jenny Young would go onto outlive Thistlewood past his death in 1786, although it is unknown whether or not she would ever receive her freedom like her mother did."

Sally was the victim of many acts of sexual assault and terrorism from various white men.

P17,SALLY,GARDENER,,,CONGO,4'1 INCHES HIGH (1762),BREADNUT ISLAND PEN,"Sally first appears in the diary in April of 1762 in a purchase that Thistlewood made from one his white associates/friends Jeremiah Meyler. He described her as a ""Congo girl"" of no more than ""9 or 10 years old"" and standing at just 4'1 inches tall. He paid 42 pounds cash for her.

Sally was originally intended and trained to be a seamstress/domestic laborer, but for the next twenty two years, she would put up regular and varied shows of resistance to every job, assignment or position that Thistlewood tried to force upon her. Even after he eventually relegated her to his field gang, Sally regularly stole food and other possessions from both white and endlsved Black people throughout the neighborhood. Over the course of her twenty two years in Jamaica, she ran away at least twelve different times.

His father may have been Neptune, an enslaved man belonging to a white man named Emotson, one of Thistlewood's friends who also owned a tavern in Savanna la Mar and was described as Abba's ""husband"" around the time of his birth. He had three surviving siblings who: an elder sister named Mary, a younger brother named Neptune and a younger sister named Jenny. 

Johnie lived to the age of seven (a milestone for a child in Jamaica at that time). In January of 1771, he became deathly ill, suffering from stmach cramps and falling into ""faints""/""fits"" (seizures). Vine, an enslaved domestic laborer and healer from the neighboring Cabaritta estate came to ""bleed"" and tend to Johnie. Three days later Thistlewood himself sent Abba with Johnie to the parish Bay to be seen and treated by a white physician, but Johnie died on the trip back home. Abba was inconsolable with grief. Johnie was buried that same evening near his mother's house. Numerous enslaved people from surrounding estates and pens, including Vine, attended his funeral, singing over him.

Several months later in July 1771, Abba was still in mourning  for Johnie, engaging in the practice of 'throwing water' and participating in communal songs and drumming in his honor."

Thistlewood paid 50 pounds for each one of them. He also described Solon as being ""about 16"". 

In later years, Solon would (like many others) be taken ill with various ailments and diseases such as stomach cramps, guinea worms, eye infections, and yaws.

Solon was a skilled fisherman and was often sent by Thistlewood to catch fish for him in nearby rivers and streaams. He was also frequently sent out to search for escaped runaways, particularly a young 'Ebo' woman named Molia who ran away from Thistlewood at least 14 times between 1769-1774.

Solon was the domestic partner/'husband' of Ogo (renamed 'Maria'), a presumed 'Ebo' African young woman purchased by Thistlewood from a slave trader named John Hutt in December of 1761. They had at least one child together: a daughter named Lucy, b0rn in November of 1766, who lived to the age of ten before dying in 1777 from stomach ailments.

P27,WONGA,MOTHER OF,LITTLE DICK,PRINCESS,AFRICAN,,EGYPT ESTATE,"Wonga was an African woman who was purchased and brought to Egypt to work as field laborer in May of 1754 shortly after Thistlewood's arrival in the early 1750's. Upon her purchase, she was renamed ""Princess,"" and paired with another enslaved woman named Quashe who served as her 'seasoner'.  

Wonga would have several confirmed sexual/domestic partners over the course of the sixteen years that Thistlewood served as overseer at Egypt. Among them were a driver named Hazat, and an Ebo man and skilled laborer named Cyrus, with whom she had a son in January of 1757 named Little Dick.

Although he survived his first two years of life, Little Dick was badly afflicted with yaws, a severe bacterial infection that resulted in skin lesions, joint inflammation and bone pain/deformities. In July of 1759, Little Dick passed away from the complications of yaws. Two months later his father, Cyrus, would go on to hold a ""feast"" (funeral ceremony) in his honor.

In 1761, Wonga was assigned to be the seasoner of an estimated 15 year old 'Ebo' young woman named Molia who had been purchased by Thistlewood and who he renamed 'Coobah'. 

Wonga ran away from the estate once in the spring of 1762. She was also pregnant at the time of her escape. Daniel, a skilled laborer was sent to search for and return her to the estate. She was later sent to Paradise estate to lie-in and give birth to a daughter named Charlotte, who survived at least until her second year."

P3,EGYPT LUCY,MOTHER OF,JULINA,,?,,EGYPT ESTATE (1750-1772),"Egypt Lucy was an Afro-Creole woman who labored on Egypt Estate's First gang for much of her life.

She had two primary domestic partners: Daniel, a skilled enslaved laborer who lived on Egypt, and Mason Quashe a skilled enslaved laborer who belonged to Elizabeth Anderson--the quadroon mistress of William Dorrill, Thistlewood's first employer-- and who was a regular visitor at Egypt to perform various tasks of carpentry, masonry, and even supervision of the First Gang. 

Between 1750 and her death in 1772, Egypt Lucy had three confirmed pregnancies: one in October 1754 to her daughter Julina with Daniel, the second in August of 1758 to an unnamed son (presumably also with Daniel) who died at just 5 days old, and the third in November of 1759 to a son who was named Little Quashe (presumably after his father, Mason Quashe).

In May 1760, Egypt became the wet nurse to John, the son of Egypt's housekeeper and Thistlewood. This seemed to mark the beginining of a strong and lasting friendship between not only Egypt Lucy and Phibbah, but between Egypt Lucy and Phibbah's broader social network of enslaved domestic workers. This circle included Phibbah's sister, Nancy,her daughter Accubah, an enslaved healer woman named Vine, and another enslaved domestic worker called House Franke. Together, the six women formed an agricutural co-op of sorts, pooling the money and resources they earned through the selling of goods they raised from their provison grounds, their raising of livestock, and from sewing work they were contracted to perform for whites. They intended the funds to be used to purchase at least one of each other's freedom.

Egypt Lucy was relatively prosperous as a enslaved business woman; such that in 1769, she along with Phibbah, and House Franke gave Thistlewood a 27 pound loan to help him in his transition from Egypt's overseer to an independeny penkeeper of a property called Breadnut Island Pen. EGypt Lucy would als give Thistlewood a second personal loan of 10 pounds; he would go on to repay both loans within about a year. 

Following her stint as John's wetnurse, Egypt Lucy continued to act as a care provider and parental influence for both Phibbah's children. When Phibbah and Thistlewood moved away from Egypt and left John behind, they entrusted EGypt Lucy to escort him to their newhome on Breadnut Islabd Pen for visits. Egypt Lucy also kept abreast of the day-to-day and night-to-night activities of Phibbah's daughter Accubah--including her covert fasincination and involvement in the secret Myal society.

On multiple occasions throughout the years, Egypt Lucy was chosen by her white masters to be a 'seasoner,' a role designed for mostly Afro-Creole enslaved men and women who had either been born or resided in Jamaica for extended periods of time to acclimate/'season' newly arrived Africans to their new realities. In December of 1761, after purchasing 6 new Africans from a slave trader named John Hutt, Thistlewood tasked Egpyt Lucy with being the seasoner of a young African girl included in this sale named Ogo (he would rename her Maria). In November of 1766, Ogo would give birth to her first child: a daughter named Lucy.

In July 1770, shortly following Molia's fourth escape from and return to Breadnut Island Pen, Egypt Lucy paid a visit to the pen, where she interrupted Thistlewood's attempt to punish Molia by confining her to a set of bilboes, convincing him not to.

Egypt Lucy was relatively prosperous as a enslaved business woman; such that in 1769, she along with Phibbah, and House Franke gave Thistlewood a 27 pound loan to help him in his transition from Egypt's overseer to an independeny penkeeper of a property called Breadnut Island Pen. EGypt Lucy would als give Thistlewood a second personal loan of 10 pounds; he would go on to repay both loans within about a year. 

Following her stint as John's wetnurse, Egypt Lucy continued to act as a care provider and parental influence for both Phibbah's children. When Phibbah and Thistlewood moved away from Egypt and left John behind, they entrusted EGypt Lucy to escort him to their newhome on Breadnut Islabd Pen for visits. Egypt Lucy also kept abreast of the day-to-day and night-to-night activities of Phibbah's daughter Accubah--including her covert fasincination and involvement in the secret Myal society.

On multiple occasions throughout the years, Egypt Lucy was chosen by her white masters to be a 'seasoner,' a role designed for mostly Afro-Creole enslaved men and women who had either been born or resided in Jamaica for extended periods of time to acclimate/'season' newly arrived Africans to their new realities. In December of 1761, after purchasing 6 new Africans from a slave trader named John Hutt, Thistlewood tasked Egpyt Lucy with being the seasoner of a young African girl included in this sale named Ogo (he would rename her Maria). In November of 1766, Ogo would give birth to her first child: a daughter named Lucy.

In July 1770, shortly following Molia's fourth escape from and return to Breadnut Island Pen, Egypt Lucy paid a visit to the pen, where she interrupted Thistlewood's attempt to punish Molia by confining her to a set of bilboes, convincing him not to.

As a field laborer, Egypt Lucy was frequently in poor health. In June of 1772, she died. Phibbah and a 12 year old John attended her funeral and burial."

Like many other fieldhands, Mountain Lucy lived in conditions of immense poverty and food scarcity. Throughout periods of particularly severe famine and droughts on the estate, she appeared to have engaged in a coercive sexual relationship with Thistlewood in exchange for food, ""bitts"" (money), and other presents. 

In 1755, when Egypt's domestic housekeeper Phibbah became pregnant, she  ""brought"" Mountain Lucy to Thistlewood to ""keep"" as a ""sweetheart"" (sexual partner) while she was in her latter trimester of pregnancy. Thistlewood initially resisted the arrangement, but eventually relented.

Mountain Lucy was the mother of at least four children. In 1756, she gave birth to a girl, Prue, who managed to survive at least until the age of 8 (an enormous milestone for enslaved chilren in Jamaica), and who Mountain Lucy claimed had been fathered by Thistlewood, presumably duringPhibbah';s lying in period (although he denied this). Between 1758 and 1759, she gave birth to two boys, once each year, who both died within days. Another girl, Flora would follow in 1761 and survive until at least the age of 3. 

Mountain Lucy ran away from the estate at least twice in 1756. She was found within days on both occasions and punished with brutal floggings and gaggings. She was also punished on multiple occasions for giving verbal protests to the drivers in the field"

Thistlewood intended for her to be a domestic worker, setting her to train in the cookroom with Egypt's housekeeper Phibbah, then hiring her out to other white neighbors throughout the parish.

Abba would have several domestic/sexual partners over the course of the twenty eight years she appears in the diaries. The first of these was Hazat, a driver who belonged to William Mould, an owner of a neighboring plantation. Another was Cudjoe, an enslaved fieldhand who belonged to John Rickett, one of Thistlewood's friends. A third was Neptune, an enslaved man who belonged to a Savanna la Mar tavern owner and another of Thistlewood's friends, Thomas Emotson. A fourth was Lincoln, the very first enslaved person Thistlewood ever purcahsed.

Abba was unique among the many enslaved women who appear in the diairies in the sense that was extremely fertile, having a total of thirteen pregnancies over the span of twenty eight years. Ten of these resulted in live births, one in a stillbirth. Of these ten children, six (Including Johnie, Neptune, Jenny, Mary)survived their first year of life  and four survived until at least 1786, the year of Thistlewood's death and the last year of the diary records.

Abba was known to tell the Anansi spider stories that she had learned from her homeland alongside Vine, an enslaved domestic woman and healer from a neighboring plantation called Cabaritta Estate.

BREADNUT ISLAND PEN (1767-1786)","Abba was an enslaved African young woman, first appearing in the diary in Februaryof 1758 when she was purchased by Thistlewood from a slave trader named John Parkinson for 46 pounds. Thistlewood intended for her to be a domestic worker, setting her to train in the cookroom with Egypt's housekeeper Phibbah, then hiring her out to other white neighbors throughout the parish.

Abba would have several domestic/sexual partners over the course of the twenty eight years she appears in the diaries. The first of these was Hazat, a driver who belonged to William Mould, an owner of a neighboring plantation. Another was Cudjoe, an enslaved fieldhand who belonged to John Rickett, one of Thistlewood's friends. A third was Neptune, an enslaved man who belonged to a Savanna la Mar tavern owner and another of Thistlewood's friends, Thomas Emotson. A fourth was Lincoln, the very first enslaved person Thistlewood ever purcahsed.

Abba was unique among the many enslaved women who appear in the diairies in the sense that was extremely fertile, having a total of thirteen pregnancies over the span of twenty eight years. Ten of these resulted in live births, one in a stillbirth. Of these ten children, six (Including Johnie, Neptune, Jenny, Mary)survived their first year of life  and four survived until at least 1786, the year of Thistlewood's death and the last year of the diary records.

Abba and her children's living arrangements fluctuated usually depending upon who her current sexual/domestic partner was, but for a period of time in 1767, she and Mary, Johnie and Neptune lived with Sally, a Congo woman who Thistlewood had first purchased as a 8 or 9 year old child in 1762.

A prominent and influential figure among the broader enslaved communit, Phibbah often leveraged that influence to gain relative material and social benefits for herself, her children and her other loved ones.

Phibbah was very close with a sister named Nancy who lived on a neighboring plantation and very frequently visited her.

Phibbah had an unnamed enslaved husband, but this relationship was soon displaced by the sexual/domestic relationship she would strike up with Thistlewood that would last for over three decades, ending only in his death in 1786.

The diaries depict Phibbah as having three confirmed pregnancies/children. The first was a daughter named Accubah [unknown date of birth and father; also called Coobah and later Jenny Young], a stillborn boy [with John Cope, born ] and John [her son with Thistlewood who lived to the age of 20].

Phibbah had a tight knit circle of friends, most of whom were enslaved women domestic laborers.

Following the birth of her son John in 1760, she also became very close friends with an enslaved field woman of Egypt estate called Egypt Lucy who served as John's wetnurse. Phibbah often visited with Egypt Lucy, cared for her son Little Quashe when he was will. She also brought Egypt Lucy into the agricultural co-op network that she had formed with her sister, daughter and other friends.

Phibbah was a very prosperous businesswoman and in 1769, she along with Egypt Lucy, and House Franke gave Thistlewood a 27 pound loan to help him in his transition from Egypt's overseer to an independent penkeeper of a property called Breadnut Island Pen-- a loan that he would return about a year or so later.

The diaries depict Phibbah as having three confirmed pregnancies/children. The first was a daughter named Accubah [unknown date of birth and father; also called Coobah and later Jenny Young], a stillborn boy [with John Cope, born ] and John [her son with Thistlewood who lived to the age of 20].

Phibbah had a tight knit circle of friends, most of whom were enslaved women domestic laborers. These included her sister Nancy, her daughter Accubah, domestic laborer and healer Vine, and domestic laborer House Franke. Following the birth of her son John in 1760, she also became very close friends with an enslaved field woman of Egypt estate called Egypt Lucy who served as John's wetnurse. Phibbah often visited with Egypt Lucy, cared for her son Little Quashe when he was will. She also brought Egypt Lucy into the agricultural co-op network that she had formed with her sister, daughter and other friends. Together, the six women pooled the money and resources they earned through the selling of goods they raised from their provison grounds, their raising of livestock, and from sewing work they were contracted to perform for whites. They intended the funds to be used to purchase at least one of each other's freedom.

Phibbah was a very prosperous businesswoman and in 1769, she along with Egypt Lucy, and House Franke gave Thistlewood a 27 pound loan to help him in his transition from Egypt's overseer to an independent penkeeper of a property called Breadnut Island Pen-- a loan that he would return about a year or so later. It was one of several loans she would give to them him throughout their relationship.

Phibbah outlived Thistlewood, and was granted her freedom following his death in 1786."

P9,JOHN,SON OF,PHIBBAH,"MULATTO JOHN

PHIBBAH'S JOHN",MIXED RACE,FAIR SKINNED; 'MULATTO',"EGYPT ESTATE (1760)

MRS BENNETT'S","John was the mixed race son of Phibbah, the housekeeper of Egypt Estate, and Thomas Thistlewood, Egypt's overseer and the later owner of Breadnut Island Pen. Although he assumed paternal and financial support for him, Thistlewood never directly acknowledged paternity of John in the diaries, either referring to him as ""Phibbah's child"" or ""Mulatto John"".

John was born in April of 1760 in a difficult birth, assisted by a midwife from Salt River estate called Old Daphne and House Franke, his mother's close friend and business partner. In the days following his birth, John was nursed by an Egypt fieldwoman named Egypt Lucy, who would go on to become one of his mother's closest friends, business partners, and a caregiver for John when his parents moved away from him.

Phibbah secured a promise from Thistlewood in October of 1761 that John would be granted his freedom and in May of 1762, he fulfilled that promise. During the majority of his childhood, the freed John was sent to live in a boarding school for mixed race children where he learned how to read and write, was eventually apprenticed to become a carpenter at the age of 15, and allowed to join in Jamaica's 'colored' militia. One of his childhood friends was James, the son of a mixed race domestic laborer named Little Mimber on a neighboring plantation.

John was not diligent in his apprenticeship, often absenting from work for days on end. He was frequently in debt, and involved in domestic disputes. 

John lived to the age of twenty, then died in September of 1780 of a sudden, putrid stomach infection that turned his fingernails black and shredded his intestines. Phibbah was beside herself with grief, later suspecting that he had been willfully poisoned as a result of a love triangle gone horribly wrong. The death struck a heavy blow to the broader enslaved community, many of whom came to his burial. John’s half-sister Accubah came to stay with their mother for several weeks afterwards. "
